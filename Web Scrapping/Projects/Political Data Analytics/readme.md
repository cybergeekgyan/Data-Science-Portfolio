## Political Data Analytics 

People are no longer restricted to making friends on social media websites; 
the sites have also become a platform for people to voice their opinions. 
Digital movements like #BlackLivesMatter, #MeToo, etc., have been recognized worldwide and discussed widely on a global level. 
Political parties have also realized the importance of social media influence, and thus, 
there is a significant inclination towards utilizing social media data to understand a party’s impact.

-  Scrape the public posts to analyze the generic sentiments of a country’s citizens towards a specific political party.

#### Recommended Web Scraping Tool:
