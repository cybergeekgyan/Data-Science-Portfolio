# Analysing Company Financials

- Analyzing a company’s financial statements is crucial if you plan to invest in them directly or indirectly and with web scraping, we can surely make better decisions.

- For this project, We can scrape data of a company we are interested in through the Yahoo Finance website. 

- It is essential that before proceeding with the project idea, you make sure that the company’s data is present in Yahoo’s database.


#### Recommended Web Scraping Tool: 

 - Python’ *Beautiful Soup* and *Selenium* will be a good pick for implementing this project as Yahoo Finance uses JavaScript. 
 - Selenium is a tool that is compatible with Python and can be used to run web browsers automatically.
