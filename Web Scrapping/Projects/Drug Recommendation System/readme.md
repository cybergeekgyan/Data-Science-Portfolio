# Drug Recommendation System

- One usually walks into a pharmacy and asks for medicines that their doctors have pre-prescribed for simple health problems like body ache, a runny nose, or a headache. 
- But, often, the same medication is not available everywhere, and it is difficult to reach out to your doctor for such minor problems. 
- In that case, looking at the drugs of a few other medicines that might help us resolve our minor issues is not a bad idea.

### Project Idea: 

- Using WebMD’s database, We can build a drug recommendation system. The website has authentic content for medical news and the drug components of several medicines.
- We can scrape the requiured data from this website to realize this project’s solution.

#### Recommended Web Scraping Tool: 

  - Using Python’s web scraping framework, *Scrapy*, we can download the website’s content for one of the most interesting web scraping with python projects.
