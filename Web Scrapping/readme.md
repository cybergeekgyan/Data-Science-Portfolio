## Significance of Web Scraping Projects in Data Science

- When working on data science-related projects, it is not always possible to have a pre-polished dataset that one can use for solving problems. In such cases, it is always recommended to build our dataset by scraping relevant websites. 

- Thus, We must work on as many web scraping projects as possible if you wish to become a successful data scientist. 

- Here are a few instances of industries where you can utilize your web scraping techniques:

   - Finance: Here, Financial Managers use web scraping methods to analyze stock prices and in an attempt to predict them 
              using machine learning algorithms.

   - Real-Estate: They use web scraping techniques to inspect what factors influence the prices of Houses, Plots, etc.

   - Gaming: Gaming industry members utilize web scraping to understand their customers’ feedback and make necessary changes in their games accordingly.

   - Sports: Sports data is often analyzed by programmers to guide people who are interested in legal betting.

   - Entertainment: Entertainment industry heavily relies on its customers’ reviews for high viewership. 
                    It is thus crucial for them to constantly invest in analyzing their customers’ feedback through web scraping.



## Requirements
A few of these projects use browser automation, but most do not. For this, I use **Selenium** to automate the browser.  Other libraries that are used include:
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup
- lxml


## Expectations
These projects are designed to give you experience web scraping, but assume that you have some basic familiarity with at least Requests and BeautifulSoup. Selenium is not used extensively enough to need familiarity, but you will need to install it on the few projects that require it.


## Caution
While I will try to keep these projects updated, please keep in mind that websites can change at any time, rendering an existing scraper useless. This is unfortunately the nature of webscraping. Your production models will require constant attention and maintenance to ensure they are delivering the data and results that you expect.
