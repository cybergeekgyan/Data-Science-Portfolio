## PROBLEM STATEMENT

1. We are part of a company called SECOND CARS and we sell used cards.
2. During a recent company survey it was observed that cars belonging to ‘Chevrolet’ are not priced correctly by the sellers. Some of the cars are way overpriced and some of the cars are way under priced which has caused substantial loss in the previous quarter.
3. To remedy this the senior management has tasked us to create a model which will efficiently predict the price of cars with minimum error. So that it will be helpful to the sales people to correctly price the car.
4. They have also asked us to prepare a decision tree for the sellers who want to also use their own intuition combined with the model.
5. They have asked us to create interactive dashboards for our sellers with non technical background.
6. They have also asked us to create a RESTful API which will be used by IT departments of our other clients programmatically to get the pricing.

## Objectives

- Company Data is in a SQLite database. So We need to extract rows only belonging to ‘Chevrolet’.
- Convert Data into a pandas DataFrame.
- Train the machine learning model And Save The Machine Learning Model.
- Create a RESTful API and deploy in heroku.
- Create a Plotly Dash Dashboard as a front end for sellers to find the price also deploy on heroku.
