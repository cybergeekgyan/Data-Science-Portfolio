# Stock Price Prediction

We will create the Deep Learning model closest to "Artificial Intelligence". Why is that? Because this model will have Long-term memory, Just like us, Humans.

- The Branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks.Classic RNNs have Short-Memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason.

- But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise ti the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field. 

- In this model we will implement this ultra-powerful model, and we will take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google Stock Price.
