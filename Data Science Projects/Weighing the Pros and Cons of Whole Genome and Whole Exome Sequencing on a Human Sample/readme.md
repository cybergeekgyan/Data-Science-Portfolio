# Weighing the Pros and Cons of Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing on a Human Sample

- Comparing the differences between sequencing an entire human genome and sequencing only the exome, or the DNA that is eventually translated into protein.
- Can we obtain a complete picture of someone's genetic disease predispositions from only the exome, or is there information lurking in introns that can provide doctors with vital information? 
- How do we weigh the trade-offs when considering genome and exome sequencing?
