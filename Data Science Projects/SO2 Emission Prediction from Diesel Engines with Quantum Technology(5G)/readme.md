### Aim 

- The aim of this project is to design a Quantum Artificial Intelligence brain that learns the emission values of SO2 gases releases from diesel engines in the world with the 8-layer Quantum Algorithm, and then to compare the performance of the created Quantum Artificial Intelligence brain with Machine Learning, Deep Learning (Classical Neuronal Networks).

### Performance (Accuracy)

- Quantum Artificial Intelligence algorithms have been proven to be more performant than Machine Learning and Deep Learning artificial intelligence systems.

### Speed

- Quantum AI algorithms have been proven to be faster than Machine Learning and Deep Learning artificial intelligence systems.

### Energy

- It has been proven that Quantum Artificial Intelligence algorithms use less energy in commercial/academic uses after model formation than Machine Learning and Deep Learning artificial intelligence systems. You can access this proof by file size.

### Usage Area

- This project has proven to be compatible with 5G technology. The result obtained from the logarithm of the division of the byte rates transferred at 5G speed to the model accuracy is more than the result obtained in 4G technology, as in the following mathematical calculation.

```
5G = 10Gbps

4G = 0.1Gbps

log(5G/model_byte) = 2.698970004336X

log(4G/model_byte) = 0.69897000433602X
```
