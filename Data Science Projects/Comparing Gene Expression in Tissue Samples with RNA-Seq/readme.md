# Comparing Gene Expression in Tissue Samples with RNA-Seq

- we will learn how RNA-Sequencing can be applied to perform tissue-level gene expression analysis.
- In particular, which is more similar on a gene expression level: different tissues from the same organism, or analogous tissues from related species? 
- This question was the subject of recent debate and a Twitter controversy
