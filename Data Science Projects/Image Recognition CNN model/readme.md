# Image Recognition CNN Model

- We will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. 

- We will Implement this Deep Learning Model to recognize a Cat or a Dog in a set of pictures. However this model can be reused to detect anything else.

- For example :- We will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs,
                 then you will literally be able to take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have.
