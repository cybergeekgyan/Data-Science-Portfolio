# Fraud Detection

In this Unsupervised Deep Learning Models, the business challenge here is about 
  
  - detection of fraud in credit card applications.


  - We will be creating a Deep Learning model for a Bank and We are given a dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card.
  
  - This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form.


# Goal

- Our task is to detect potential fraud within these applications which means we will come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications
