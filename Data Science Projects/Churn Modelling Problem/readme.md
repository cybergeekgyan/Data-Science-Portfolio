# Churn Modelling Problem

- We will be solving a Data Analytics challenge for a Bank. We will be given a dataset with a large sample of the Bank's customers.
- To make this dataset, the Bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc.
- During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the Bank.

## Goal 

- Make an Artificial Neural Network that can prdict, based on geo-demographical and Transanctional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the Bank or stay (customer churn).

- Beside all this We rank all the customers of the Bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do this we will need to use the right Deep Learning Model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach.

- By applying our Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.
