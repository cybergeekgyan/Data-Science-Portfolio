# Early deteciton of lung cancer

- The first step in creating a machine learning model for early detection of lung cancer using retinal fundus images is to collect a dataset of retinal fundus images. 
- This dataset should include both images of healthy retinas and images of retinas with lung cancer.

- Once the dataset is collected, the next step is to pre-process the images. 
- This includes resizing the images, normalizing the pixel values, and removing any noise or artifacts.

- The next step is to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. 
- This model will be used to classify the retinal fundus images as either healthy or containing lung cancer. 
- The CNN model should be trained on the pre-processed dataset.

- Once the CNN model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new retinal fundus images. 
- If the model predicts that an image contains lung cancer, then it can be used as an early detection tool for lung cancer.

- Finally, the model should be evaluated to ensure that it is performing accurately. 
- This can be done by testing the model on a separate dataset of retinal fundus images and comparing the model's predictions to the actual labels.
