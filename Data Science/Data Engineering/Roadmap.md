# Complete Data Engineering Roadmap

[Roadmap]https://www.kdnuggets.com/2022/11/complete-data-engineering-study-roadmap.html)

## 1. Foundation

Python
 
If you chose Python as your programming language, here are some recommended courses:
|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|----|-----|

| [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022 - Udemy]()|
| [Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) - Coursera (University of Michigan)]()|
 

SQL

Complete SQL Mastery - CodeWithMosh
 

The Essentials
 

Data Engineering Essentials using SQL, Python, and PySpark - Udemy

### 2. Mathematics and Statistics
 

Just like any other career that involves the use of data analytics and the engineering of it - Maths is always needed. It will allow you to understand your day-to-day tasks much better as well as be able to apply your skills more effectively. 

Here are some other resources to help you:

Statistics Fundamental by Josh Starmer - YouTube
Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning - Udemy
Statistics for Data Science and Business Analysis - Udemy

### 3. Database Management Systems
 

As a Data Engineer, you will be working with Database Management Systems a lot - as they assist in handling large datasets. There are a lot of Database Management Systems out there, so don’t feel the pressure of needing to know all of them. That depends on the company you work for, or what you prefer working with.

### 4. Data Warehousing and Data Pipelines
 

This area of focus is what differentiates Data Engineers from Data Scientists. Both learn the same fundamentals and use the same programming languages, SQL, etc. But data warehousing and data pipelines are what sets Data Engineers aside - making them good Data Engineers.

The resource I would recommend for Data Warehouse are:

The Data Warehouse Toolkit - PDF Book. This book was written by one of the people who built a part of the foundations for data warehouses - Ralph Kimball.
Data Warehousing Tutorial - Articles
Database vs Data Warehouse vs Data Lake - YouTube
Below are some resources to learn about Data Pipelines:

Data Pipelines Explained - YouTube
ETL vs ELT - Article
Building Data Engineering Pipelines in Python - DataCamp




### 5. Cloud Computing
 

Last but not least, Cloud Computing. You won't need to know everything, but you should have a decent understanding of different providers, their capabilities, limitations, etc. 

You will need to know the basics of cloud computing, such as IAAS, PAAS, and SAAS as well as the architecture of cloud computing.

Here are some resources on cloud computing:

Cloud Computing Tutorials and Resources
Cloud Data Engineering - Coursera
Cloud Courses - cloudacacemy



### 6. Analytics Engineering 
 

Analytics engineering is also important to learn. It consists of:

ETL (Extract Transform and Load)
Creating data models (dbt model)
Testing and documenting
Deployment to the cloud and locally
Visualizing the data with analytical application (google data studio and metabase)
You can learn all of these concepts through the DataTalksClub YouTube playlist.

Here are some additional resources to help you:

dbt Free Courses - dbt

Analytics Engineering Bootcamp - Udemy

Learn DBT from Scratch - Udemy

### 7. Projects
 

It seems like that’s a lot of learning - it is. That’s why it is imperative that you feel proficient in each of those areas to be a successful Data Engineer. You can do this stage during your learning or after - it is up to you. Some people prefer to apply their knowledge and skill after all the learning, some prefer to do it during, in order to test themselves.

So the next stage is applying your code and putting your skills to the test. Your project list should aim to hit all of these areas:

Explore different types of Data Formats
Data Warehousing
Data Analytics
Data Sourcing
Big Data Tools
 

Ideas for Data Engineering projects
 

Data Engineering Zoomcamp - real-world project
Scrape Stock and Twitter Data Using Python, Kafka, and Spark
Web-scraping with real-estates
Building A Data Platform
Snowflake Real-Time Data Warehouse
Out of Data Engineering, you can practice your coding skills with LeetCode challenges, however, this can be applied to the majority of tech careers.

 

### 8. Interview Preparation
 

The moment that all of you have been waiting for but are sweating bricks about - the interview. There is a lot of content to remember, so preparing yourself is the best thing you can do for yourself. 

Here are some resources to help you:

1001 Data Engineering Interview Questions
60+ Data Engineer Interview Questions and Answers in 2022
If Python is your chosen programming language, it would be good to internalize the Google Python Style Guide
