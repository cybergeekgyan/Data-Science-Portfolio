# Data Visualization CheatSheet

`Data Visualization` `Data Literacy`

Data visualization is one of the most widely-used data skills—and is often called the "gateway drug" into data science.

## How to Capture a Trend
These data visualizations allow you to display a trend over time. Here's a breakdown of these charts:

- **Line chart**: The most straightforward way to capture how a numeric variable is changing over time
- **Multi-line chart**: Captures multiple numeric variables over time. It can include multiple axes allowing comparison of different units and scale ranges
- **Area chart**: Shows how a numeric value progresses by shading the area between line and the x-axis
- **Stacked area chart**: Most commonly used variation of area charts, the best use is to track the breakdown of a numeric value by subgroups
- **Spline chart**: Smoothened version of a line chart. It differs in that data points are connected with smooth curves to account for missing values, as opposed to straight lines

## How to Visualize Relationships

*These data visualizations allow you to display relationships between data points. Here's a breakdown of these charts:*

- **Bar chart**: One of the easiest charts to read which helps in quick comparison of categorical data. One axis contains categories and the other axis represents values.

- **Column chart**: Also known as a vertical bar chart, where the categories are placed on the x-axis. These are preferred over bar charts for short labels, date ranges, or negatives in values.

- **Scatter plot**: Most commonly used chart when observing the relationship between two variables. It is especially useful for quickly surfacing potential correlations between data points.

- **Connected scatterplot**: A hybrid between a scatter plot and a line plot, the scatter dots are connected with a line 

- **Bubble charts**: Often used to visualize data points with 3 dimensions, namely visualized on the x-axis, y-axis, and with the size of the bubble. It tries to show relations between data points using location and size

- **World cloud chart**: A convenient visualization for visualizing the most prevalent words that appear in a text. This can be used to visualize the relationship between different words that appear together or capture a trend on the most commonly prevalent words.

## Part-to-whole Charts

These data visualizations allow you to show sub-categories within a large category

- **Pie chart**: One of the most common ways to show part to whole data. It is also commonly used with percentages
- **Donut pie chart**: The donut pie chart is a variant of the pie chart, the difference being it has a hole in the center for readability
- **Heat maps**: Heatmaps are two-dimensional charts that use color shading to represent data trends
- **Stacked column chart**: Best to compare subcategories within categorical data. Can also be used to compare percentages

## How to Visualize a Single Value

*These data visualizations allow you to visualize a single data point

- **Card**: Cards are great for showing and tracking KPIs in dashboards or presentations
- **Table chart**: Best to be used on small datasets, it displays tabular data in a table
- **auge chart**: This chart is often used in executive dashboard reports to show relevant KPIs
- **Treemap charts**: 2D rectangles whose size is proportional to the value being measured and can be used to display hierarchically structured data

## How to Capture Distributions

*These data visualizations allow you to visualize the distribution of a variable*

- **Histograms**: Shows the distribution of a variable. It converts numerical data into bins as columns. The x-axis shows the range, and the y-axis represents the frequency

- **Box plot**: Shows the distribution of a variable using 5 key summary statistics—minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum

- **Violin plot**: A variation of the box plot. It also shows the full distribution of the data alongside summary statistics

- **Density plot**: Visualizes a distribution by using smoothing to allow smoother distributions and better capture the distribution shape of the data

## Visualize a flow

*These data visualizations allow you to visualize how data points flow into eachother*

- **Sankey chart**: Useful for representing flows in systems. This flow can be any measurable quantity
- **Chord chart**: Useful for presenting weighted relationships or flows between nodes. Especially useful for highlighting the dominant or important flows
- **Network chart**: Similar to a graph, it consists of nodes and interconnected edges. It illustrates how different items have relationships with each other
