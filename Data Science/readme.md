## 10 common AI terms explained in an easily understandable way.

1. Classification : 
A Machine Learning task which seeks to classify data points into different groups (called targets or class labels) that are pre-determined by the training data. For example, if we have a medical dataset consisting of biological measurements...(heart rate, body temperature, age, height, weight, etc.) and whether or not a person has a specific disease, we could train a classification model to predict whether or not a person has the disease given just the biological measurements.

2. Regression :
A supervised learning task that tries to predict a numerical result given a data point. For example, giving the description of a house (location, number of rooms, energy label) and predicting the market price of the house.

3. Underfitting
A phenomenon in which a Machine Learning algorithm is not fitted well enough to the training data, resulting in low performance on both the training data and similar but distinct data. A common example of underfitting occurs when a neural network is not trained long enough or when there is not enough training data. The converse phenomenon is overfitting.

4. Overfitting
A phenomenon in which a Machine Learning algorithm is too fitted to the training data, making performance on the training data very high, but performance on similar but distinct data low due to poor generalizability. ... A common example of overfitting occurs when a neural network is trained for too long. The converse phenomenon is underfitting.
