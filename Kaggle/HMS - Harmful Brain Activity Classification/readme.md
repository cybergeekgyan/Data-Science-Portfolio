# HMS - Harmful Brain Activity Classification

Goal : Classify seizures and other patterns of harmful brain activity in critically ill patients

### Overview

The goal of this competition is to detect and classify seizures and other types of harmful brain activity. You will develop a model trained on electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded from critically ill hospital patients.

Your work may help rapidly improve electroencephalography pattern classification accuracy, unlocking transformative benefits for neurocritical care, epilepsy, and drug development. Advancement in this area may allow doctors and brain researchers to detect seizures or other brain damage to provide faster and more accurate treatments.
