# Enefit - Predict Energy Behavior of Prosumers

Goal: Predict Prosumer Energy Patterns and Minimize Imbalance Costs.

### Overview
The goal of the competition is to create an energy prediction model of prosumers to reduce energy imbalance costs.

This competition aims to tackle the issue of energy imbalance, a situation where the energy expected to be used doesn't line up with the actual energy used or produced. Prosumers, who both consume and generate energy, contribute a large part of the energy imbalance. Despite being only a small part of all consumers, their unpredictable energy use causes logistical and financial problems for the energy companies.
